      "adjunctive treatment of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Acarbose is unlikely to give adequate glucose control when used alone and most recommend dietary\n",

      "obstruction or predisposition to obstruction, chronic intestinal disease with marked disorders of digestion or absorption, and when excessive gas formation would be\n",

      "caution in patients with renal dysfunction or severe liver disease.\n",
      "Adverse Effects: Adverse effects reported in cats include flatulence, soft stools and diarrhea; in dogs, diarrhea and weight loss. Adverse effects are more likely at higher doses.\n",
      "While acarbose alone does not cause hypoglycemia, it may contribute to it by reducing the rate and amount of glucose absorbed when the patient is receiving other\n",
      "hypoglycemic agents (insulin, oral hypoglycemics).\n",
      "Overdosage/Acute Toxicity: Acute overdosages are likely to cause only diarrhea and flatulence. No treatment should be necessary. Should acute hypoglycemia occur secondary to other\n",

      "Doses: DOGS:\n",
      "a) For dogs poorly controlled with insulin and dietary therapy when another reason for the poor control cannot be identified: Initially 12.5–25 mg total dose per\n",

      "opioids), acepromazine can potentiate their analgesic effect (neuroleptanalgesia).\n",
      "In horses, acepromazine is labeled “… as an aid in controlling fractious animals,” and in conjunction with local anesthesia for various procedures and treatments. It\n",
      "is also commonly used in horses as a pre-anesthetic agent at very small doses to help control behavior.\n",
      "Although not FDA-approved, it is used as a tranquilizer (see doses) in other species such as swine, cattle, rabbits, sheep and goats. Acepromazine has also been\n",
      "shown to reduce the incidence of halothane-induced malignant hyperthermia in susceptible pigs.\n",
      "Pharmacology/Actions\n",
      "Acepromazine is a phenothiazine neuroleptic agent. While the exact mechanisms of action are not fully understood, the phenothiazines block post-synaptic dopamine\n",
      "receptors in the CNS and may also inhibit the release of, and increase the turnover rate of dopamine. They are thought to depress portions of the reticular activating\n",
      "system that assists in the control of body temperature, basal metabolic rate, emesis, vasomotor tone, hormonal balance, and alertness. Additionally, phenothiazines have\n",
      "varying degrees of anticholinergic, antihistaminic, antispasmodic, and alpha-adrenergic blocking effects.\n",
      "The primary desired effect for the use of acepromazine in veterinary medicine is its tranquilizing action. Additional pharmacologic actions that acepromazine\n",
      "possess, include antiemetic, antispasmodic, and hypothermic actions. Some researchers have reported that acepromazine has anticonvulsant activity, but in veterinary\n",
      "medicine it is generally felt that phenothiazines should not be used in epileptic animals or those susceptible to seizures (e.g., post-myelography) as it may precipitate\n",
      "seizures.\n",
      "Acepromazine may decrease respiratory rates, but studies have demonstrated that little or no effect occurs with regard to the blood gas picture, pH or\n",
      "oxyhemoglobin saturation. A dose dependent decrease in hematocrit is seen within 30 minutes after dosing in horses and dogs. Hematocrit values in horses may\n",
      "decrease up to 50% of pre-dose values; this is probably due to increased splenic sequestration of red cells.\n",
      "Besides lowering arterial blood pressure in dogs, acepromazine causes increases in central venous pressure, a vagally induced bradycardic effect and transient\n",
      "sinoatrial arrest. The bradycardia may be negated by a reflex tachycardic effect secondary to decreases in blood pressure. Acepromazine also has antidysrhythmic\n",
      "effects. Acepromazine has been demonstrated to inhibit the arrhythmias induced by ultra-short acting barbiturates, and protect against the ventricular fibrillatory actions\n",
      "of halothane and epinephrine. Other pharmacologic actions are discussed in the adverse effects section below.\n",
      "Pharmacokinetics\n",
      "The pharmacokinetics of acepromazine has been studied in the horse (Ballard et al. 1982). The drug has a fairly high volume of distribution (6.6 L/kg), and is more\n",
      "than 99% protein bound. The onset of action is fairly slow, requiring up to 15 minutes following IV administration, with peak effects seen in 30–60 minutes. The\n",
      "elimination half-life in horses is approximately 3 hours.\n",
      "Acepromazine is metabolized in the liver with both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites eliminated in the urine. Metabolites may be found in equine urine up\n",
      "to 96 hours after dosing.\n",
      "Contraindications/Precautions/Warnings\n",
      "Animals may require lower dosages of general anesthetics following acepromazine. Use cautiously and in smaller doses in animals with hepatic dysfunction, mild\n",
      "cardiac disease, or general debilitation. Because of its hypotensive effects, acepromazine is relatively contraindicated in patients with significant cardiac disease,\n",
      "hypovolemia, hypotension or shock. Acepromazine has been said to decrease platelet aggregation and its use avoided in patients with coagulopathies or\n",
      "thrombocytopenia, but a study in 6 healthy dogs showed no platelet inhibition (Conner et al. 2009). Phenothiazines are relatively contraindicated in patients with\n",
      "tetanus or strychnine intoxication due to effects on the extrapyramidal system.\n",
      "Intravenous injections should be made slowly. Do not administer intra-arterially in horses since it may cause severe CNS excitement/depression, seizures and death.\n",
      "Because of its effects on thermoregulation, use cautiously in very young or debilitated animals.\n",
      "Two retrospective studies in dogs (McConnell et al. 2007), (Tobias & Marioni-Henry 2006) did not show any increase in seizure activity after administration of\n",
      "acepromazine.\n",
      "When used alone, acepromazine has no analgesic effects; treat animals with appropriate analgesics to control pain. The tranquilization effects of acepromazine can\n",
      "be overridden and it cannot always be counted upon when used as a restraining agent. Do not administer to racing animals within 4 days of a race.\n",
      "In dogs, acepromazine’s effects may be individually variable and breed dependent. Dogs with MDR1 mutations (many Collies, Australian shepherds, etc.) may\n",
      "develop a more pronounced sedation that persists longer than normal. The Veterinary Clinical Pharmacology Lab at Washington State recommends reducing the dose\n",
      "by 25% in dogs heterozygous for the MDR1 mutation (mutant/normal) and by 30–50% in dogs homozygous for the MDR1 mutation (mutant/mutant). (WSU-\n",
      "VetClinPharmLab 2009)\n",
      "Acepromazine should be used very cautiously as a restraining agent in aggressive dogs as it may make the animal more prone to startle and react to noises or other\n",
      "sensory inputs. In geriatric patients, very low doses have been associated with prolonged effects of the drug. Giant breeds and greyhounds may be extremely sensitive\n",
      "to the drug while terrier breeds are somewhat resistant to its effects. Atropine may be used with acepromazine to help negate its bradycardic effects.\n",

      "anesthesia.\n",
      "Adverse Effects\n",
      "Acepromazine’s effect on blood pressure (hypotension) is well described and an important consideration in therapy. This effect is thought to be mediated by both\n",
      "central mechanisms and through the alpha-adrenergic actions of the drug. Cardiovascular collapse (secondary to bradycardia and hypotension) has been described in\n",
      "all major species. Dogs may be more sensitive to these effects than other animals.\n",
      "Acepromazine has been shown to decrease tear production in cats (Ghaffari et al. 2010).\n",
      "In male large animals acepromazine may cause protrusion of the penis; in horses, this effect may last 2 hours. Stallions should be given acepromazine with cautionIn male large animals acepromazine may cause protrusion of the penis; in horses, this effect may last 2 hours. Stallions should be given acepromazine with caution\n",
      "as injury to the penis can occur with resultant swelling and permanent paralysis of the penis retractor muscle. Other clinical signs that have been reported in horses\n",
      "include excitement, restlessness, sweating, trembling, tachypnea, tachycardia and, rarely, seizures and recumbency.\n",
      "Acepromazine’s effects of causing penis extension in horses and prolapse of the membrana nictitans in horses and dogs, may make its use unsuitable for show\n",
      "animals. There are also ethical considerations regarding the use of tranquilizers prior to showing an animal or having the animal examined before sale.\n",
      "Occasionally an animal may develop the contradictory clinical signs of aggressiveness and generalized CNS stimulation after receiving acepromazine. IM injections\n",
      "may cause transient pain at the injection site.\n",
      "Reproductive/Nursing Safety\n",
      "In humans, the FDA categorizes phenothiazines as category C for use during pregnancy (Animal studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus, but there are no\n",
      "adequate studies in humans; or there are no animal reproduction studies and no adequate studies in humans.) In a separate system evaluating the safety of drugs in\n",
      "canine and feline pregnancy (Papich 1989), this drug is categorized as in class: B (Safe for use if used cautiously. Studies in laboratory animals may have uncovered\n",
      "some risk, but these drugs appear to be safe in dogs and cats or these drugs are safe if they are not administered when the animal is near term.)\n",
      "Overdosage/Acute Toxicity\n",
      "The LD in mice is 61 mg/kg after IV dosage and 257 mg/kg after oral dose. While a toxicity study in dogs reported no adverse effects in dogs receiving 20–40\n",
      "50\n",
      "mg/kg over 6 weeks, since 2004 the ASPCA Animal Poison center has documented adverse effects in dogs receiving single doses between 20–42 mg/kg. Dogs have\n",
      "survived oral dosages up to 220 mg/kg, but overdoses can cause serious hypotension, CNS depression, pulmonary edema and hyperemia.\n",
      "There were 70 exposures to acepromazine maleate reported to the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) during 2008–2009. In these cases 49 were dogs\n",
      "with 37 showing clinical signs and the remaining 21 reported cases were cats with 17 cats showing clinical signs. Common findings in dogs recorded in decreasing\n",
      "frequency included ataxia, sedation, lethargy, depression, and protrusion of the third eyelid, somnolence, bradycardia, and recumbency. Common findings in cats\n",
      "recorded in decreasing frequency included sedation, ataxia, lethargy, protrusion of the third eyelid, and depression.\n",
      "Because of the apparent relatively low toxicity of acepromazine, most overdoses can be handled by monitoring the animal and treating clinical signs as they occur;\n",
      "massive oral overdoses should definitely be treated by emptying the gut if possible. Hypotension should not be treated initially with fluids; alpha-adrenergic pressor\n",
      "agents (epinephrine, phenylephrine) can be considered if fluids do not maintain adequate blood pressure. Seizures may be controlled with barbiturates or diazepam.\n",
      "Doxapram has been suggested as an antagonist to the CNS depressant effects of acepromazine.\n",

      "Acepromazine’s effects of causing penis extension in horses and prolapse of the membrana nictitans in horses and dogs, may make its use unsuitable for show\n",

      "may cause transient pain at the injection site.\n",

      "Pharmacokinetics\n",
      "Amikacin, like the other aminoglycosides is not appreciably absorbed after oral or intrauterine administration, but is absorbed from topical administration (not from\n",
      "skin or the urinary bladder) when used in irrigations during surgical procedures. Patients receiving oral aminoglycosides with hemorrhagic or necrotic enteritises may\n",
      "absorb appreciable quantities of the drug. After IM administration to dogs and cats, peak levels occur from ½–1 hour later. Subcutaneous injection results in slightly\n",
      "delayed peak levels and with more variability than after IM injection. Bioavailability from extravascular injection (IM or SC) is greater than 90%.\n",
      "After absorption, aminoglycosides are distributed primarily in the extracellular fluid. They are found in ascitic, pleural, pericardial, peritoneal, synovial and abscess\n",
      "fluids; high levels are found in sputum, bronchial secretions and bile. Aminoglycosides are minimally protein bound (<20%, streptomycin 35%) to plasma proteins.\n",
      "Aminoglycosides do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier nor penetrate ocular tissue. CSF levels are unpredictable and range from 0–50% of those found in the\n",
      "serum. Therapeutic levels are found in bone, heart, gallbladder and lung tissues after parenteral dosing. Aminoglycosides tend to accumulate in certain tissues such as\n",
      "the inner ear and kidneys, which may help explain their toxicity. Volumes of distribution have been reported to be 0.15–0.3 L/kg in adult cats and dogs, and 0.26–0.58\n",
      "L/kg in horses. Volumes of distribution may be significantly larger in neonates and juvenile animals due to their higher extracellular fluid fractions. Aminoglycosides\n",
      "cross the placenta; fetal concentrations range from 15–50% of those found in maternal serum.\n",
      "Elimination of aminoglycosides after parenteral administration occurs almost entirely by glomerular filtration. The approximate elimination half-lives for amikacin\n",
      "have been reported to be 5 hours in foals, 1.14–2.3 hours in adult horses, 2.2–2.7 hours in calves, 1–3 hours in cows, 1.5 hours in sheep, and 0.5–2 hours in dogs and\n",

      "The aminoglycosides are infamous for their nephrotoxic and ototoxic effects. The nephrotoxic (tubular necrosis) mechanisms of these drugs are not completely\n",
      "understood, but are probably related to interference with phospholipid metabolism in the lysosomes of proximal renal tubular cells, resulting in leakage of proteolytic\n",
      "enzymes into the cytoplasm. Nephrotoxicity is usually manifested by: increases in BUN, creatinine, nonprotein nitrogen in the serum, and decreases in urine specific\n",
      "gravity and creatinine clearance. Proteinuria and cells or casts may be seen in the urine. Nephrotoxicity is usually reversible once the drug is discontinued. While\n",
      "gentamicin may be more nephrotoxic and amikacin less nephrotoxic than the other aminoglycosides, the incidences of nephrotoxicity with all of these agents require\n",
      "equal caution and monitoring.\n",
      "Ototoxicity (8th cranial nerve toxicity) of the aminoglycosides can manifest by either auditory and/or vestibular clinical signs and may be irreversible. Vestibular\n",
      "clinical signs are more frequent with streptomycin, gentamicin, or tobramycin. Auditory clinical signs are more frequent with amikacin, neomycin, or kanamycin, but\n",
      "either form can occur with any of these drugs. Cats are apparently very sensitive to the vestibular effects of the aminoglycosides.\n",
      "The aminoglycosides can also cause neuromuscular blockade, facial edema, pain/inflammation at injection site, peripheral neuropathy and hypersensitivity reactions.\n",
      "Rarely, GI clinical signs, hematologic and hepatic effects have been reported.\n",
      "Overdosage/Acute Toxicity: Should an inadvertent overdosage be administered, three treatments have been recommended. Hemodialysis is very effective in reducing serum levels of the drug but\n",

Acarbose is not indicated in patients of low body weight (some say normal body weight as well) as it may have deleterious effects on nutrition status. Use\\ncaution in patients with renal dysfunction or severe liver disease.',\n",
       "  'Adverse Effects': 'Adverse effects reported in cats include flatulence, soft stools and diarrhea; in dogs, diarrhea and weight loss. Adverse effects are more likely at higher doses.\\nWhile acarbose alone does not cause hypoglycemia, it may contribute to it by reducing the rate and amount of glucose absorbed when the patient is receiving other\\nhypoglycemic agents (insulin, oral hypoglycemics).',\n",

Give only at the time of feeding. May increase dose after two weeks to 50 mg per dog and then to 100 mg per dog (in large dogs, >25\\nkg) if response has been inadequate. There is a greater chance of diarrhea at the higher dosages. (Nelson 2005)\\nb) 12.5–20 mg (total dose) per meal PO (Daminet 2003)\\nCATS:\\na) 12.5–25 mg (total dose) PO with meals.
