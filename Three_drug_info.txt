{'Medicine Name': 'ACARBOSE',
  'Uses/Indications': 'May be useful for mild reductions in blood glucose concentrations (250–350 mg/dL range) in dogs and cats with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and as\nadjunctive treatment of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Acarbose is unlikely to give adequate glucose control when used alone and most recommend dietary\ntherapy and other antihyperglycemic agents (e.g., insulin) instead.',
  'Contraindications/Precautions/Warnings': 'Acarbose is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug, diabetic ketoacidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, colonic ulceration, partial intestinal\nobstruction or predisposition to obstruction, chronic intestinal disease with marked disorders of digestion or absorption, and when excessive gas formation would be\ndetrimental. Acarbose is not indicated in patients of low body weight (some say normal body weight as well) as it may have deleterious effects on nutrition status. Use\ncaution in patients with renal dysfunction or severe liver disease.',
  'Adverse Effects': 'Adverse effects reported in cats include flatulence, soft stools and diarrhea; in dogs, diarrhea and weight loss. Adverse effects are more likely at higher doses.\nWhile acarbose alone does not cause hypoglycemia, it may contribute to it by reducing the rate and amount of glucose absorbed when the patient is receiving other\nhypoglycemic agents (insulin, oral hypoglycemics).',
  'Overdosage/Acute Toxicity': 'Acute overdosages are likely to cause only diarrhea and flatulence. No treatment should be necessary. Should acute hypoglycemia occur secondary to other\nantihypoglycemics, parenteral glucose should be administered. If treating orally, use glucose (do not use sucrose).',
  'Doses': 'DOGS:\na) For dogs poorly controlled with insulin and dietary therapy when another reason for the poor control cannot be identified: Initially 12.5–25 mg total dose per\ndog PO with each meal. Give only at the time of feeding. May increase dose after two weeks to 50 mg per dog and then to 100 mg per dog (in large dogs, >25\nkg) if response has been inadequate. There is a greater chance of diarrhea at the higher dosages. (Nelson 2005)\nb) 12.5–20 mg (total dose) per meal PO (Daminet 2003)\nCATS:\na) 12.5–25 mg (total dose) PO with meals.

Labeled indications for dogs and cats include: “… as an aid in controlling intractable animals …\nalleviate itching as a result of skin irritation; as an antiemetic to control vomiting associated with motion sickness” and as a preanesthetic agent. The use of\nacepromazine as a sedative/tranquilizer in the treatment of adverse behaviors in dogs or cats has largely been supplanted by newer, effective agents that have fewer\nadverse effects. Its use for sedation during travel is controversial and many no longer recommend drug therapy for this purpose. In combination with analgesics (e.g.,\nopioids), acepromazine can potentiate their analgesic effect (neuroleptanalgesia).\nIn horses, acepromazine is labeled “… as an aid in controlling fractious animals,” and in conjunction with local anesthesia for various procedures and treatments. It\nis also commonly used in horses as a pre-anesthetic agent at very small doses to help control behavior.\nAlthough not FDA-approved, it is used as a tranquilizer (see doses) in other species such as swine, cattle, rabbits, sheep and goats. Acepromazine has also been\nshown to reduce the incidence of halothane-induced malignant hyperthermia in susceptible pigs.\nPharmacology/Actions\nAcepromazine is a phenothiazine neuroleptic agent. While the exact mechanisms of action are not fully understood, the phenothiazines block post-synaptic dopamine\nreceptors in the CNS and may also inhibit the release of, and increase the turnover rate of dopamine. They are thought to depress portions of the reticular activating\nsystem that assists in the control of body temperature, basal metabolic rate, emesis, vasomotor tone, hormonal balance, and alertness. Additionally, phenothiazines have\nvarying degrees of anticholinergic, antihistaminic, antispasmodic, and alpha-adrenergic blocking effects.\nThe primary desired effect for the use of acepromazine in veterinary medicine is its tranquilizing action. Additional pharmacologic actions that acepromazine\npossess, include antiemetic, antispasmodic, and hypothermic actions. Some researchers have reported that acepromazine has anticonvulsant activity, but in veterinary\nmedicine it is generally felt that phenothiazines should not be used in epileptic animals or those susceptible to seizures (e.g., post-myelography) as it may precipitate\nseizures.\nAcepromazine may decrease respiratory rates, but studies have demonstrated that little or no effect occurs with regard to the blood gas picture, pH or\noxyhemoglobin saturation. A dose dependent decrease in hematocrit is seen within 30 minutes after dosing in horses and dogs. Hematocrit values in horses may\ndecrease up to 50% of pre-dose values; this is probably due to increased splenic sequestration of red cells.\nBesides lowering arterial blood pressure in dogs, acepromazine causes increases in central venous pressure, a vagally induced bradycardic effect and transient\nsinoatrial arrest. The bradycardia may be negated by a reflex tachycardic effect secondary to decreases in blood pressure. Acepromazine also has antidysrhythmic\neffects. Acepromazine has been demonstrated to inhibit the arrhythmias induced by ultra-short acting barbiturates, and protect against the ventricular fibrillatory actions\nof halothane and epinephrine. Other pharmacologic actions are discussed in the adverse effects section below.\nPharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of acepromazine has been studied in the horse (Ballard et al. 1982). The drug has a fairly high volume of distribution (6.6 L/kg), and is more\nthan 99% protein bound. The onset of action is fairly slow, requiring up to 15 minutes following IV administration, with peak effects seen in 30–60 minutes. The\nelimination half-life in horses is approximately 3 hours.\nAcepromazine is metabolized in the liver with both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites eliminated in the urine. Metabolites may be found in equine urine up\nto 96 hours after dosing.\nContraindications/Precautions/Warnings\nAnimals may require lower dosages of general anesthetics following acepromazine. Use cautiously and in smaller doses in animals with hepatic dysfunction, mild\ncardiac disease, or general debilitation. Because of its hypotensive effects, acepromazine is relatively contraindicated in patients with significant cardiac disease,\nhypovolemia, hypotension or shock. Acepromazine has been said to decrease platelet aggregation and its use avoided in patients with coagulopathies or\nthrombocytopenia, but a study in 6 healthy dogs showed no platelet inhibition (Conner et al. 2009). Phenothiazines are relatively contraindicated in patients with\ntetanus or strychnine intoxication due to effects on the extrapyramidal system.\nIntravenous injections should be made slowly. Do not administer intra-arterially in horses since it may cause severe CNS excitement/depression, seizures and death.\nBecause of its effects on thermoregulation, use cautiously in very young or debilitated animals.\nTwo retrospective studies in dogs (McConnell et al. 2007), (Tobias & Marioni-Henry 2006) did not show any increase in seizure activity after administration of\nacepromazine.\nWhen used alone, acepromazine has no analgesic effects; treat animals with appropriate analgesics to control pain. The tranquilization effects of acepromazine can\nbe overridden and it cannot always be counted upon when used as a restraining agent. Do not administer to racing animals within 4 days of a race.\nIn dogs, acepromazine’s effects may be individually variable and breed dependent. Dogs with MDR1 mutations (many Collies, Australian shepherds, etc.) may\ndevelop a more pronounced sedation that persists longer than normal. The Veterinary Clinical Pharmacology Lab at Washington State recommends reducing the dose\nby 25% in dogs heterozygous for the MDR1 mutation (mutant/normal) and by 30–50% in dogs homozygous for the MDR1 mutation (mutant/mutant). (WSU-\nVetClinPharmLab 2009)\nAcepromazine should be used very cautiously as a restraining agent in aggressive dogs as it may make the animal more prone to startle and react to noises or other\nsensory inputs. In geriatric patients, very low doses have been associated with prolonged effects of the drug. Giant breeds and greyhounds may be extremely sensitive\nto the drug while terrier breeds are somewhat resistant to its effects. Atropine may be used with acepromazine to help negate its bradycardic effects.\nIn addition to the legal aspects (not FDA-approved) of using acepromazine in cattle, the drug may cause regurgitation of ruminal contents when inducing general\nanesthesia.\nAdverse Effects\nAcepromazine’s effect on blood pressure (hypotension) is well described and an important consideration in therapy. This effect is thought to be mediated by both\ncentral mechanisms and through the alpha-adrenergic actions of the drug. Cardiovascular collapse (secondary to bradycardia and hypotension) has been described in\nall major species. Dogs may be more sensitive to these effects than other animals.\nAcepromazine has been shown to decrease tear production in cats (Ghaffari et al. 2010).\nIn male large animals acepromazine may cause protrusion of the penis; in horses, this effect may last 2 hours. Stallions should be given acepromazine with cautionIn male large animals acepromazine may cause protrusion of the penis; in horses, this effect may last 2 hours. Stallions should be given acepromazine with caution\nas injury to the penis can occur with resultant swelling and permanent paralysis of the penis retractor muscle. Other clinical signs that have been reported in horses\ninclude excitement, restlessness, sweating, trembling, tachypnea, tachycardia and, rarely, seizures and recumbency.\nAcepromazine’s effects of causing penis extension in horses and prolapse of the membrana nictitans in horses and dogs, may make its use unsuitable for show\nanimals. There are also ethical considerations regarding the use of tranquilizers prior to showing an animal or having the animal examined before sale.\nOccasionally an animal may develop the contradictory clinical signs of aggressiveness and generalized CNS stimulation after receiving acepromazine. IM injections\nmay cause transient pain at the injection site.\nReproductive/Nursing Safety\nIn humans, the FDA categorizes phenothiazines as category C for use during pregnancy (Animal studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus, but there are no\nadequate studies in humans; or there are no animal reproduction studies and no adequate studies in humans.) In a separate system evaluating the safety of drugs in\ncanine and feline pregnancy (Papich 1989), this drug is categorized as in class: B (Safe for use if used cautiously. Studies in laboratory animals may have uncovered\nsome risk, but these drugs appear to be safe in dogs and cats or these drugs are safe if they are not administered when the animal is near term.)\nOverdosage/Acute Toxicity\nThe LD in mice is 61 mg/kg after IV dosage and 257 mg/kg after oral dose. While a toxicity study in dogs reported no adverse effects in dogs receiving 20–40\n50\nmg/kg over 6 weeks, since 2004 the ASPCA Animal Poison center has documented adverse effects in dogs receiving single doses between 20–42 mg/kg. Dogs have\nsurvived oral dosages up to 220 mg/kg, but overdoses can cause serious hypotension, CNS depression, pulmonary edema and hyperemia.\nThere were 70 exposures to acepromazine maleate reported to the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) during 2008–2009. In these cases 49 were dogs\nwith 37 showing clinical signs and the remaining 21 reported cases were cats with 17 cats showing clinical signs. Common findings in dogs recorded in decreasing\nfrequency included ataxia, sedation, lethargy, depression, and protrusion of the third eyelid, somnolence, bradycardia, and recumbency. Common findings in cats\nrecorded in decreasing frequency included sedation, ataxia, lethargy, protrusion of the third eyelid, and depression.\nBecause of the apparent relatively low toxicity of acepromazine, most overdoses can be handled by monitoring the animal and treating clinical signs as they occur;\nmassive oral overdoses should definitely be treated by emptying the gut if possible. Hypotension should not be treated initially with fluids; alpha-adrenergic pressor\nagents (epinephrine, phenylephrine) can be considered if fluids do not maintain adequate blood pressure. Seizures may be controlled with barbiturates or diazepam.\nDoxapram has been suggested as an antagonist to the CNS depressant effects of acepromazine.\nDrug Interactions\nThe following drug interactions have either been reported or are theoretical in humans or animals receiving acepromazine or other phenothiazines and may be of\nsignificance in veterinary patients:\n\n\n\nACETAMINOPHEN: Possible increased risk for hypothermia\nANTACIDS: May cause reduced GI absorption of oral phenothiazines\nANTIDIARRHEAL MIXTURES (e.g., Kaolin/pectin, bismuth subsalicylate mixtures): May cause reduced GI absorption of oral phenothiazines\nCNS DEPRESSANT AGENTS (barbiturates, narcotics, anesthetics, etc.): May cause additive CNS depression if used with acepromazine\nDOPAMINE: Acepromazine may impair the vasopressive action of dopamine.\nEMETICS: Acepromazine may reduce the effectiveness of emetics\n\n\n\nEPINEPHRINE, EPHEDRINE: Phenothiazines block alpha-adrenergic receptors; concomitant use of epinephrine or ephedrine can lead to unopposed beta-\nactivity causing vasodilation and increased cardiac rate\nMETOCLOPRAMIDE: May increase risks for extrapyramidal adverse effects\nOPIATES: May enhance the hypotensive effects of acepromazine; dosages of acepromazine are generally reduced when used with an opiate\nORGANOPHOSPHATE AGENTS: Acepromazine should not be given within one month of worming with these agents as their effects may be potentiated\nPHENYTOIN: Metabolism may be decreased if given concurrently with phenothiazines\nPROCAINE: Activity may be enhanced by phenothiazines\nPROPRANOLOL: Increased blood levels of both drugs may result if administered with phenothiazines\n\n\n\nQUINIDINE: With phenothiazines may cause additive cardiac depression\nDoses\nNote: The manufacturer’s dose of 0.5–2.2 mg/kg for dogs and cats is considered by many clinicians to be 10 times greater than is necessary for most indications.

There are also ethical considerations regarding the use of tranquilizers prior to showing an animal or having the animal examined before sale.\nOccasionally an animal may develop the contradictory clinical signs of aggressiveness and generalized CNS stimulation after receiving acepromazine. IM injections\nmay cause transient pain at the injection site.',
  'Overdosage/Acute Toxicity': 'The LD in mice is 61 mg/kg after IV dosage and 257 mg/kg after oral dose. While a toxicity study in dogs reported no adverse effects in dogs receiving 20–40\n50\nmg/kg over 6 weeks, since 2004 the ASPCA Animal Poison center has documented adverse effects in dogs receiving single doses between 20–42 mg/kg. Dogs have\nsurvived oral dosages up to 220 mg/kg, but overdoses can cause serious hypotension, CNS depression, pulmonary edema and hyperemia.\nThere were 70 exposures to acepromazine maleate reported to the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) during 2008–2009. In these cases 49 were dogs\nwith 37 showing clinical signs and the remaining 21 reported cases were cats with 17 cats showing clinical signs. Common findings in dogs recorded in decreasing\nfrequency included ataxia, sedation, lethargy, depression, and protrusion of the third eyelid, somnolence, bradycardia, and recumbency. Common findings in cats\nrecorded in decreasing frequency included sedation, ataxia, lethargy, protrusion of the third eyelid, and depression.\nBecause of the apparent relatively low toxicity of acepromazine, most overdoses can be handled by monitoring the animal and treating clinical signs as they occur;\nmassive oral overdoses should definitely be treated by emptying the gut if possible. Hypotension should not be treated initially with fluids; alpha-adrenergic pressor\nagents (epinephrine, phenylephrine) can be considered if fluids do not maintain adequate blood pressure. Seizures may be controlled with barbiturates or diazepam.\nDoxapram has been suggested as an antagonist to the CNS depressant effects of acepromazine.',

  'Storage/Stability': 'Store protected from light. Tablets should be stored in tight containers. Acepromazine injection should be kept from freezing.\nAlthough controlled studies have not documented the compatibility of these combinations, acepromazine has been mixed with atropine, buprenorphine, chloral\nhydrate, ketamine, meperidine, oxymorphone, and xylazine. Both glycopyrrolate and diazepam have been reported to be physically incompatible with\nphenothiazines, however, glycopyrrolate has been demonstrated to be compatible with promazine HCl for injection.'},
